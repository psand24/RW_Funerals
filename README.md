# RW_Funerals
funeral mod for rimworld

Initial plan is to reverse-engineer and repurpose parties/weddings. Rough goals are:

-set up conditions to initialize funeral
  * host is pawn with recently deceased family member or lover;
  * Trigger from relationship, or mood debuff?

-allow grave/coffin to act as a "party spot"


-create ThoughtDefOf mood buff for having attended funeral. If possible, apply buff differently to mourning family and just other pawns. Balanced so as not to completely wipe out the initial debuff.
